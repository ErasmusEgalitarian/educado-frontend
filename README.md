- Express
- MongoDB/Mongoose

## Step-by-step guide to run Educado development setup

Below is a short guide explaining how to set up and run the educado backend in development mode.


### Setting up Node environment

- Ensure that local version of Node.js is latest stable version (v20.10.0, at the time of writing this)
  - run `node --version`
  - if version == v20.10.0, then all is good :)
  - if version is NOT v20.10.0 then do the following
    - Ensure that you have npm installed
    - run `npm install -g n` to install node version manager
    - when installed, run `n stable`, to install latest stable version of node


### Setting up local repository
Get the .env file from whoever is in charge of the secrets. The 2023 responsible was Frederik Bode Thorbensen: from Software semester 7 of AAU CPH. The dev keys contain the following values:

### The .env file should contain the following values:
VITE_S3_SECRET 
VITE_S3_BUCKET
VITE_S3_REGION
VITE_BACKEND_URL


### Installing node dependencies

- In root folder of the repo run `npm install`
- Run `npm install` again


### Run app in development mode

- Run `npm run dev` to start application
- Rest api runs on ://localhost:8888


## Tests 
- Run `npm run test` to run ALL jest test for the front end 
- Run `npm test "TestFileName.test.js"` to run a single jest test suite for the front end 
 
### Creating and running tests - Cypress

- Run `npm run cypress-server` to run the server for Cypress
- In a new terminal, run `npx cypress open` to open the Cypress test runner
- Choose the type of test you want to run/create, will open a new browser

For test running:
- Select the test you want to run
- The test will run in the browser, and you can see the results in the Cypress test runner

For test creation:
- Create a new test
- A new file will be created in the Cypress folder


## Deploment 
- Changes pushed to the staging branch on Github will automaticly complited an run on https://app-staging.educado.io/ 
- Staging has very strick rules and will go to 404 page if any error accoces
- Imports are more strick on Staging for example "import  Icon  from '@mdi/react'" and "import { Icon } from '@mdi/react'" works on dev, but only "import { Icon } from '@mdi/react'"; works staging.
